        Frequently Asked Questions

        We aim to answer the most frequently asked questions about hair transplants with clarity.
        What is the hair treatment cost in Kolkata?
        The hair treatment cost in Kolkata depends on factors like the type of treatment and individual hair concerns. Hairfree and Hairgrow Clinic offers advanced and affordable solutions for hair regrowth and restoration with high success rates. Know More

        What is a hair transplant?
        A hair transplant is a minimally invasive procedure where healthy hair follicles are moved from one part of the scalp (usually the back or sides) to areas with thinning or no hair. Know More

        Is a hair transplant permanent?
        Yes! The transplanted hair follicles are typically resistant to hair loss and will continue to grow naturally for a lifetime. Know More

        Does a hair transplant look natural?
        Absolutely. With advanced techniques like FUE and FUT, the results look completely natural. The transplanted hair blends seamlessly with your existing hair. Know More

        Is the procedure painful?
        The procedure is performed under local anesthesia, so there’s minimal discomfort during the process. Most patients describe the experience as painless. Know More

        What is the recovery time?
        Most people return to normal activities within 2 to 5 days. You may experience mild redness or scabbing for a week, but it typically resolves quickly. Know More

        When will I see results?
        New hair usually starts growing within 3 to 4 months. Full results are visible between 9 to 12 months after the procedure. Know More
